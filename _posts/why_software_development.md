# Why Software Development?

I decided to start learning software development to become a builder of useful programs. I think that being able to understand how programs are built or being able to develop programs from scratch is a very powerful - and fun - skill that is needed in any startup or large company in the modern world. I'm excited to be living in a time where relevant tech companies had their starts in a dorm with just one computer. It's an interesting time to be living in, and I'm learning how to code so that I have the necessary toolset to make the best out of it.
